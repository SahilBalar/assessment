# Copilot Instructions for Assessment Project

## Project Overview
This is a simple static frontend assessment project consisting of basic HTML and CSS files. The main content is located in the `localRepo/` directory.

## Architecture
- **Main Files**: 
  - `localRepo/index.html`: Basic HTML structure with a single div element containing placeholder text.
  - `localRepo/style.css`: Simple CSS styling for the div (red text on grey background).
- **Structure**: Flat file structure with no dynamic components, JavaScript, or backend integration.
- **Purpose**: Appears to be a basic web development assessment task demonstrating fundamental HTML/CSS usage.

## Development Workflow
- **Running the Project**: Open `localRepo/index.html` directly in a web browser.
- **Development**: Use VS Code's Live Server extension for automatic reloading during development.
  - Install Live Server extension if not present.
  - Right-click `localRepo/index.html` and select "Open with Live Server".
- **No Build Process**: No compilation, bundling, or package management required.

## Conventions and Patterns
- **File Organization**: HTML and CSS are separated into distinct files, linked via `<link rel="stylesheet">`.
- **Styling Approach**: Inline element selectors (e.g., `div` in `style.css`) for simple, direct styling.
- **Content**: Placeholder text like "yo sdfasdas" indicates this is a starting template for further development.

## Dependencies and Integration
- **None**: Pure static HTML/CSS with no external libraries, frameworks, or APIs.
- **No Cross-Component Communication**: Single-page static content.

## Key Files to Reference
- `localRepo/index.html`: Entry point and HTML structure.
- `localRepo/style.css`: Styling definitions.
